# Supervised Learning Capstone Project
## Project is from the Udemy course: 2022 Python for Machine Learning & Data Science Masterclass

-----------  
## Purpose of Project  
This is a capstone project that uses all the skills learned up to this point in the course.  
The project analyzes a customer information data set from a tele-communications company.
The data is organized, explored


## Program version  
- Python version 3.9.12  
- Jupyter Notebook version 6.4.8  
- Visual Studio version 1.73.1  

## Skills  
[] Read in data using pandas  
[] Explore data set using pandas  
[] Create visuals using Seaborn and matplotlib    
[] Create Decision tree and Random Forest models through scikit-learn  
[] model performance evaluation using scikit-learn metrics  
[] visualization of metrics using confusion matrix display  

## Improvements  
I need to go through the project and try adjusting other parameters to see if I can improve the efficiency of the model.  
It may be good to reduce the lines by removing some redundancy of coding, e.g. looking at the data set after doing some filtering of the data frame.  

## Comments  
I chose to include this exercise in my portfolio because it demonstrates the skills to organize data and use of the machine learning trees methods.  
I found the course to be very valuable in learning the techniques through hands-on exercises!
